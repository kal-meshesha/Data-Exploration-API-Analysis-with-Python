# Data Exploration with Python
## Exploratory Data Analysis | API Integration | Business Insights
### Executive Summary

A New York coffee shop chain needed insight into sales performance, product profitability, and customer behavior. Additionally, I practiced extracting environmental data using an external API.

Using Python, I cleaned and explored 50,000+ transaction records to analyze product margins, customer spending patterns, and profit drivers. I also demonstrated API integration by retrieving air quality data using automated requests.

The analysis identified high-margin products, valuable customer segments, and sales trends that support data-driven marketing and inventory decisions.

### Business Problem
Coffee Shop Analysis

The coffee shop owner wanted to understand:

Which products generate the highest margins?

Which customer groups spend the most?

Which products drive the most profit?

Which customer segment should be targeted for marketing?

Raw transactional data needed cleaning and structured analysis to produce meaningful business recommendations.

### Methodology
#### Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing values

Processed date fields

Structured product and customer data

Verified transaction consistency

Created summary dataframes for analysis

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed profit margins by product category

Evaluated sales by customer segment

Identified top-performing products

Created visualizations to support findings

Explored time-based trends in sales performance

#### API Integration (Air Quality – Part A)

Identified correct API endpoints

Automated data collection using Python loops

Structured API responses into usable dataframes

This demonstrated the ability to gather external data programmatically.

### Key Insights

Certain product categories offer significantly higher margins.

Specific customer groups generate more sales.

High-profit products should be prioritized in marketing efforts.

Sales patterns vary across products and customer segments.

### Business Recommendations

Promote high-margin products more aggressively.

Target marketing campaigns toward high-spending customer groups.

Adjust inventory strategy based on top-performing products.

Continue leveraging data to guide pricing and promotions.

### Next Steps

If given more time, I would:

Build a predictive sales model.

Perform customer segmentation analysis.

Conduct time-series forecasting on sales trends.

Create an interactive dashboard for management reporting.
